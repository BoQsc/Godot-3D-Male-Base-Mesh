# 3D Male Base Mesh
![](./Preview/VeZyqq_preview_small.png)![](VQ93Qd.png)
### How to use
To use this 3D Male Base Mesh, you can drag .glb file into the scene,  
right-click on the male_base_mesh node and click "Make Local" 

You may then add to the scene a Camera3D node and a DirectionalLight3D.  
Then click button "Run Project" (F5) button to run the scene.  


For New to Godot: dealing with Gizmos  
If you are very new to Godot Engine, you might also want to temporary hide weird   
colored wireframes temporary: these are known as Gizmos and can be disabled by   
clicking "Perspective" button on the left top corner in the scene of Godot  

The next step would probably be creating animations for Male Base Mesh.  
However the overall revision of Male Base Mesh might be needed and important to have.  

This is a simple T Pose Male Base Low Poly Mesh with Armature, no embedded animations.  
Maintainer Note: I use Blender 4.3.2 version to maintain this .glb project  
Tested on Godot Engine 4.3  

The next step: animations
Basic Idle Animation of Male 3d Mesh.  
The most basic idle animation for a 3D character typically involves small, subtle movements that give the impression of life without any major motion.  
* Breathing: Small shift in overall body overtime; or The chest or abdomen slightly rises and falls in a slow, rhythmic manner to simulate breathing.  
* Weight shifting: The character slightly shifts its weight from one leg to the other, maybe with a small adjustment of the posture to avoid a static pose.  
* Small hand or arm movements: Fingers might twitch or hands may subtly sway, giving the impression of relaxed movement.  
* Head movement: The character might make tiny adjustments in head position, such as tilting slightly or a minimal turn, to make it look more natural.

This type of animation adds realism without requiring complex motions or actions. The focus is on making the character seem "alive" in a stationary position.
