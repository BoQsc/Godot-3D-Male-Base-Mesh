# 3D Male Base Mesh
![](./Preview/VeZyqq_preview_small.png)![](VQ93Qd.png)
### How to use
To use this 3D Male Base Mesh, you can drag .glb file into the scene,  
right-click on the male_base_mesh node and click "Make Local" 

You may then add to the scene a Camera3D node and a DirectionalLight3D.  
Then click button "Run Project" (F5) button to run the scene.  


For New to Godot: dealing with Gizmos  
If you are very new to Godot Engine, you might also want to temporary hide weird   
colored wireframes temporary: these are known as Gizmos and can be disabled by   
clicking "Perspective" button on the left top corner in the scene of Godot  

The next step would probably be creating animations for Male Base Mesh.  
However the overall revision of Male Base Mesh might be needed and important to have.  

This is a simple T Pose Male Base Mesh with Armature.
